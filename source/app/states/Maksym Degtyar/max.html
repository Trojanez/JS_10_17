		<p>SANTA ANA, Calif. — It still won't make her smile, but Grumpy Cat has won some scratch.</p> 
		<p>A California jury gave the furry frown queen more than $700,000 this week in a federal lawsuit over the use of her identity.</p>   
		<p>According to documents obtained by The Washington Post, owner Tabatha Bundesen of Morristown, Arizona, won the lawsuit first filed three years ago against the Grenade beverage company.</p>

		<p>She signed on for the cat to endorse a "Grumpy Cat Grumpuccino," but the company subsequently used the cat's image to help sell other products, which an eight-person jury on Monday found was unauthorized.</p>
		<p>“Ironically, while the world-famous feline Grumpy Cat and her valuable brand are most often invoked in a tongue-and-cheek fashion, Defendants’ despicable misconduct here has actually given Grumpy Cat and her owners something to be grumpy about,” the <a href="http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/national/grumpy-cat-complaint/2720/">complaint obtained by The Washington Post</a> stated.</p>
		<p>David Jonelis, the attorney for Grumpy Cat Limited, told <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/internets-grumpy-cat-awarded-710001-in-licensing-spat/">Courthouse News</a> the verdict was a "complete victory."</p>
		<p>“Grumpy Cat feels vindicated and feels the jury reached a just verdict," he said.</p>
		<p>Grumpy Cat, whose dwarfism and underbite give her the permanent frown she's famous for, became an online phenomenon-turned-merchandising-machine after Bundesen first posted pictures of her in 2012.</p>
